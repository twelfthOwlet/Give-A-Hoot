December 2023; Completed due to weather break in February 2024
<pre> 
Plan: Replace alternator, replace PCV Valve, replace mounting bolts, bypass AC Compressor

Parts: Aftermarket alternator, PCV Valve, suitable serpentine belt, 
       mounting bolts for alternator, power steering pump mounting bolts, zip ties
  
Dec 25: 
Alternator extraction procedure.  **pulled battery and charged it, otherwise, disconnect from circuit.
 -- Used long(~14.5") 14mm closed, ratcheting wrench on tensioner bolt to pull serpentine belt off ps pump
 -- Remove the top black plastic divider protecting radiator/fan: should be fastened by snap pins(removal tool is advised)
 -- Remove both brackets holding cooling fan for accessibility(10mm)
 -- Remove overflow container for accessibility(had black zip tie holding it)
 -- Remove power steering pump mounting bolts and push aside(12mm)
 -- Unplug main plastic alternator connector(Use caution using channel locks)
 -- Use fingers to put socket on lower, driverside alternator mounting bolt head and then rachet off(12mm)
 -- Use 4" extension, if needed, and socket for passengerside, lower alternator bolt(12mm)
 -- Remove last alternator bolt(12mm)
 -- Pull alternator out a bit, pull off rubber boot to get to 10mm nut and take it off to remove the alternator.
        *Notes:
              Pulley on new alternator 2.5" dia., old 2" dia. 
              2 bolts for power steering pump on order: 
                  Part No.: 95701-08045-08  Bolt, Flange (8X45)
              2 lower bolts for alternator on order:
                  Part No.: 95701-08055-08  Bolt, Flange (8X55)
              Belt is normally 69.5", 7 rib.  Research suggests K070553 belt "should" work for AC bypass
              K070553 on order(55 13/16")
              Beck/Arnley PCV Valve on order 
       
Feb 4: Completed repairs thanks to a break in the weather.  No issues with belt and larger alt pulley.

February 2024: Found oil leak and tailpipe separated from muffler
<pre>
Discovery:  Closer inspection of oil leak shows oil pan had rusted through: needs replaced.
            When raising the vehicle, found tailpipe hanging by rubber hanger.
            Closer inspection of tailpipe connection, looks like it slipped from clamps, but severely rusted.

Plan:  Replace the oil pan, oil, oil filter, and fix tailpipe. 

Parts:  Oil pan, gasket material(Specific RTV but found an actual paper gasket too), oil, oil filter(oil pan bolts,
       studs[flattened a stud already,lol]), piece of flex pipe, and 2 2.125 exhaust clamps.

Note: Sub-frame and most the under-carriage on drivers side is pretty rusted.  Will probably be in my best interest
       to look for another beater for Winter transportation.
Feb 12:
       - I am using a Youtube video from TRQ for oil pan rather than the service manual
       - Lowering the subframe: need 4 pull jacks
       - oil pan uses an Hondabond seal, but I may use an aftermarket gasket depending on thickness.
       - oil pan bolts are not all the same: Found 3 bolts holding oil pan at crankshaft area are different.
       - oil pan has two studs
       - oil pan bolts: 11 are the same, as long as you know where the studs go, the difference is minimal.
       
-- Supported the vehicle with 4 jack stands in proper locations.
-- Removed the front wheels for visibility and possibly different angles to work
-- Removed the spash shield
-- Unseated oil dip stick and fill cap
-- Drained oil and removed oil filter
-- Started process of breaking bolts loose on oil pan
-- One stud nut came loose, the other pulled the stud out: attempted to break nut from stud. 
       Flattened threads while doing it.  Need another stud.  Figured I would track bolts down for purchase.
-- Created a template of oil pan to place bolts in proper location as I wait for tools and parts. 
-- Placed pull jacks in three locations in connection to sub-frame- two on flat areas near the back and one under front
-- Broke free the front motor mount bolt(17mm)- has a capture nut on other side.  Use PB Blaster or comparable to remove bolt
-- Advise PB Blast'ing the 4 sub-frame bolts in a break free, squirt, run it back up and then back down
-- Advised to bring down a finger width for each of the 4 17mm bolts in sub-frame corners
-- Removed the 10mm bolts from the oil pan.
-- Broke the seal on the oil pan-- not the kosher way, but used a pry bar on the oil pan edge exposed to get a gap.
       Then used a small, flat nail-puller/scraper/pry bar to separate the pan.  Pan did not drop past the sub-frame.
-- Remember gravity and vibration are not your friends, as rust dropped past my safety glasses and into my eye.  
       Feeling stupid.  **Waiting on face shield.
-- *Looks like next step is to pull the two front sub-frame bolts out since oil pan did not drop, and pry the sub-frame 
       down to get the oil pan to drop.*
-- Had to remove the two front sub-frame bolts and use a prybar to remove the oil pan.
-- Scraped old gasket material from mating surface with razor blade and used a scotchpad to clean the surface.
-- Installed a new stud.  Pried sub-frame down to get oil pan past sub-frame.
-- Installed oil pan with a bottom layer of Hondabond to hold gasket in place.  Advise securing and torquing pan bolts while
       sub-frame is lowered(8.7 ftlb/12 Nm).  Tightening in recommended pattern is advised.
-- Made sure drain plug was secure.  Installed new oil filter and added oil to check for simple leaks.
-- Reinstalled front sub-frame bolts.  Tightened all sub-frame bolts to ~78 ftlb.  Installed motor mount bolt.  
       Checked alignment of engine mount bolt to capture nut- it is off.
-- Lowered all sub-frame bolts a finger-width down again.  Found capture nut moves, lol. While fiddling with the nut, it popped
       out and landed in the dual fan assembly, lol. Reinstalled nut and again attempted to align bolt to captured nut.
-- Raised the front sub-frame bolts and it seemed to align for me.  Tightened the engine mount bolt to about 47 ftlbs.
-- Tightened and torqued all sub-fram bolts.
-- Started vehicle, check for pressurized leaks.
-- Installed splash shield.  Put front wheels back on, torqued them.  Removed all jack stands.  
-- Take two: Backed vehicle up on ramps.  Tailpipe separated from muffler pipe.  After knocking off all the rust on the clamps,
       the clamps fell apart.  Chiseled off the sleeve material, installed flex pipe, and clamped it down.
-- Test drove vehicle for ~30 miles, retorqued front wheels, and no issues occurred.  Completed: Feb 16, 2024.
