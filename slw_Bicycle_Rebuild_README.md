Checked out old trail bicycle to find largest chainring of three was bent.  
Found new old chainring in box with bottom bracket(BB).
Lots of research stated the BB on bicycle would accept a different BB assy: 68mm standard.
While inspecting other areas, found front derailleur is fed from the top, around a plastic pulley and onto the fr. der.
Not happy about that, so scrapped the project for the old bicycle and started anew.

Removed old components from old trail bicycle.
Checked reuse of components.  Had new crankset and Bottom Bracket I thought would not thread in-- research.
Ordered a 56cm frame, as that is same as my road bicycle.
Late research suggests the headset bearing assembly is garbage, lol, uh yeah.

Check wheels for abnormal movement and dish.  Checked derailleurs: replace front, rear is good.  Handlebars cracked, CF.
Order handlebars, went a bit smaller 660mm instead of 680mm, may fit better.
Ordered threadless Origin 8 headset.  Did not take into count a change in the crown race on the fork needs changed out.
Two hours, w/o proper tools, to remove the crown race.  Very slight damage to the fork tube, buffed out and sprayed bare metal.
Installed Origin 8 crown race- another couple hours.  Used what I had to attempt to seat the race flush, lol, not fun w/o press.
Beat races out of old frame, used old headset as a pusher against new race, stacked old races against the old headset, used
  old frame as pusher, on top put old spacers on steering tube and used a 35mm socket as a hammering point-of-contact.

Eventually, the new crown race seated with, luckily, no damage.
Installed new fork to new frame.  Tapped in the steerer keeper, installed spacers, stem, and riser handlebars.
Tightened & checked headset.  Tightened stem to handlebars. 
Installed new old GXP BB and FireEX crankset(175mm[may want to go smaller in future]) as not happy with powerspline setup.
Installed old two-way pedals: clip and a non-clip side for preference.
Installed old Deore rear derailleur.  Installed new front derailleur.  Installed new chain(in my stock).
Chain can quickly be released with a linkage tool .. not link breaker.  Squeeze the master link together with the tool to release.
Installed rear and front wheels from old bicycle.
Install hydraulic brake calipers.
Check shifter and brake placement.  Replaced the shifter cable for fr. der.  Will need to replace rear der. cable.
After placement is satisfactory, will need to adjust derailleurs, gearing, and hydraulic braking.
Will need to install hand grips and other accessories.
Need to test.
