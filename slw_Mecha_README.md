Alternator extraction procedure.  **pulled battery and charged it, otherwise, disconnect from circuit.
 -- Used long(~14.5") 14mm closed, ratcheting wrench on tensioner bolt to pull serpentine belt off ps pump

 -- Remove power steering pump mounting bolts and push aside(12mm)
 -- Unplug main plastic alternator connector(Use caution using channel locks)

              Pulley on new alternator 2.5" dia., old 2" dia. 
              2 bolts for power steering pump on order:

February 2024: Found oil leak and tailpipe separated from muffler
<pre>
Discovery:  Closer inspection of oil leak shows oil pan had rusted through: needs replaced.
            When raising the vehicle, found tailpipe hanging by rubber hanger.
            Closer inspection of tailpipe connection, looks like it slipped from clamps, but severely rusted.

Plan:  Replace the oil pan, oil, oil filter, and take to a muffler shop for further tailpipe choices. 

Parts:  Oil pan, gasket material(Specific RTV), oil, oil filter(oil pan bolts, studs[flattened a stud already,lol])   

Feb 12:
       - I am using a Youtube video from TRX rather than the service manual
       - Lowering the subframe: need 4 pull jacks
       - oil pan uses an RTX seal, but may use an aftermarket gasket depending on thickness.
       - oil pan bolts are not all the same
       - oil pan has two studs

-- Supported the vehicle with 4 jack stands in proper locations.
-- Removed the front wheels for visibility and possibly different angles to work
-- Unseated oil dip stick and fill cap
-- Drained oil and removed oil filter
-- Started process of breaking bolts loose on oil pan
-- One stud nut came loose, the other pulled the stud out: attempted to break nut from stud. 
       Flattened threads while doing it.  Need another stud.  Figured I would track bolts down for purchase.
-- Created a template of oil pan to place bolts in proper location as I wait for tools and parts.
