# Give-A-Hoot

An aficionado of technological security, defense, mechanics, music, electronics, movies, space, multi-dimensional beings, and intellects of all kinds. There is usually something battling on, simmering down, or what-have-you to experience, perhaps some of mine will be of comfort or help. <br>
<pre>This site seems geared toward coding or CI/CD typical scenarios for which my universe is

  the history blanks in given time.</pre>
